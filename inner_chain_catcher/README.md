Inner chain guard
=================
It’s annoying when you shift down at the front, and end up with a chain scratching your bottom bracket.  It’s really annoying when you’re using a triple crankset on a tandem, with the inner ring running the timing chain - this happens not infrequently on our tandem, and it’s a real pain - particularly as, once the chain ends up inside the spider, it’s a pig to get out again.

This chain guard cable-ties onto the inboard side of our 34t timing ring, and makes it harder for the chain to pop off - it also ensures that, if it does pop off, it can’t slip between the frame and the rings.
