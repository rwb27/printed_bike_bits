Mudguard to velocity rack mount
===============================
My bike isn't just a hobby, it's a means of transport.  That means it has to cope with being ridden wherever, and whenever, I need to get somewhere.  So decent mudguards (SKS chromoplastics) are a must.  That said, I have always hated the way mudguards tend to wobble around and rattle - rattly bikes drive me potty.

I have a Tortec Velocity rear rack on my commuter bike; it's very narrow and really stiff, I'm a big fan.  It comes so close to the mudguard, it seems ridiculous to have those spindly little wires supporting the mudguard when I could just use the rack.  That's particularly the case given that I only have one set of eyelets for both rack and mudguards.

I bought some extra bridges (the metal fitting that usually connects the mudguard to the frame near the brakes, on the bridge between the seat stays or on the fork crown).  This printed adapter lets me add in links between the two sides of the rack, so I have something to attach the bridge to.

Also, my bike (Eastway R3.0) was clearly not built with mudguards in mind, so the mudguard_mount is designed to be cable tied on top of the mount for my brakes, to provide somewhere to screw in the M6 mounting screw for the mudguard near the brakes.
