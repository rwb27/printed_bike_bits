Richard's 3D printed bike bits
==============================
This repo is a collection of printed parts that I use on my bikes.  They are not safety-critical or load bearing components, for obvious reasons!  However, the odd 3D printed clamp here or there can make some custom things possible that would otherwise be a real pain; in case anyone else fancies using these, I thought I'd make them public.  

Everything in this repository should be considered to be (c) Richard Bowman, 2015-2017, and released under the CERN open hardware license.  If you modify them for your own purposes, please share them - and if you upload to Thingiverse/instructables/similar I'd be grateful if you could credit this repository as inspiration.

Contents
========
* [Folding kit](http://www.github.com/rwb27/printed_bike_bits/helios_fold/) to allow the two halves of a[Circe Cycles](http://www.circecycles.co.uk/) Helios tandem to be reattached into a neat package for easy transport by train, ferry, etc. - you can wheel it on two wheels, so it eliminates the need to carry the ~20kg package any distance.
* [Rack mount for OnGuard Brute lock](http://www.github.com/rwb27/printed_bike_bits/rack_mount_onguard_brute/) that lets me quickly stash my D lock on one side of a Tortec Velocity pannier rack.
* [Mudguard supports](http://www.github.com/rwb27/printed_bike_bits/mudguard_to_velocity_rack/) that connect my mudguard to my Tortec Velocity rear rack, in order to minimise wobble.
